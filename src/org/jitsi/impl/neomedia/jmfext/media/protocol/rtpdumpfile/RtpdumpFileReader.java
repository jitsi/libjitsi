 * rtpdump file can be generated with wireshark from RTP stream, just go to :
 * -> Telephony -> RTP -> Show All Streams
 * then select the RTP stream you want to record, and click on "Save As".
 * 
 * If the RTP menu isn't found in the Telephony menu, maybe you can find it in
 * the "Statistics" menu (in old version of Wireshark).
