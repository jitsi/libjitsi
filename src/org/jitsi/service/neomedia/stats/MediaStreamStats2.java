/**
 * An extended interface for accessing the statistics of a {@link MediaStream}.
 *
 * The reason to extend the {@link MediaStreamStats} interface rather than
 * adding methods into it is to allow the implementation to reside in a separate
 * class. This is desirable in order to:
 * 1. Help to keep the old interface for backward compatibility.
 * 2. Provide a "clean" place where future code can be added, thus avoiding
 * further cluttering of the already overly complicated
 * {@link org.jitsi.impl.neomedia.MediaStreamStatsImpl}.
